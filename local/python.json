{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the first line in a script?", "completion": "The first line of a script, also known as the shebang line, specifies the interpreter that should be used to run the script."}
{"prompt": "What does #!/usr/bin/python3 mean?", "completion": "This line tells the operating system to use the Python 3 interpreter located in the /usr/bin directory to run the script."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between #!/usr/bin/python3 and #!/usr/bin/env python3?", "completion": "The first one specifies the exact path to the Python 3 interpreter, while the second one uses the env command to find the Python 3 interpreter in the system's environment settings."}
{"prompt": "Why is #!/usr/bin/env python3 recommended?", "completion": "This is because it allows the system to find the Python 3 interpreter even if it's not installed in the default /usr/bin directory."}
{"prompt": "What happens when the system sees the #!/usr/bin/env python3 line?", "completion": "The system will first check the environment settings to find the installation path of Python 3, and then use the corresponding interpreter to run the script."}
{"prompt": "How can I import the time module in Python?", "completion": "You can import the entire module using `import time`, and then reference its functions using `time.sleep(1)`."}
{"prompt": "How can I import all functions from the time module?", "completion": "You can use `from time import *`, and then reference the functions directly using `sleep(1)`."}
{"prompt": "How can I import a specific function from the time module?", "completion": "You can use `from time import sleep`, and then reference the function using `sleep(1)`."}
{"prompt": "Can I give an alias to the time module?", "completion": "Yes, you can use `import time as abc`, and then reference the module's functions using `abc.sleep(1)`."}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages of importing specific functions from a module?", "completion": "Importing specific functions can help avoid naming conflicts and make your code more readable."}
{"prompt": "What are the advantages of giving an alias to a module?", "completion": "Giving an alias to a module can make your code more readable and easier to understand, especially when working with long module names."}
{"prompt": "How can I use the print function in Python to format output?", "completion": "You can use the % operator to format strings, similar to printf in C/C++."}
{"prompt": "What is the syntax for using the % operator with print?", "completion": "The syntax is `print(\"format string\" % value)`, where the format string contains placeholders and the value is the value to be inserted."}
{"prompt": "What are some examples of using the % operator with print?", "completion": "For example, `print(\"100 + 200 = %d\" % 300)` or `print(\"A的小写是%s\" % \"a\")`."}
{"prompt": "How can I insert multiple values into a format string?", "completion": "You can use a tuple to insert multiple values, like this: `print(\"%d + %d = %d\" % (100, 200, 300))`."}
{"prompt": "What are the different placeholders that can be used in a format string?", "completion": "Some common placeholders include `%s` for strings, `%d` for signed decimal integers, `%u` for unsigned decimal integers, and `%f` for floating-point numbers."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between `%x` and `%X`?", "completion": " `%x` uses lowercase letters for hexadecimal digits, while `%X` uses uppercase letters."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between `%e` and `%E`?", "completion": " `%e` uses lowercase letters for scientific notation, while `%E` uses uppercase letters."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between `%g` and `%G`?", "completion": " `%g` uses the lowest number of significant digits for floating-point numbers, while `%G` uses the highest number of significant digits."}
